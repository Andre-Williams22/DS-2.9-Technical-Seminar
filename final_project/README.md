## Project Description
The DRL Agent will be a culmination of several reinforcement learning strategies that learn to analyze, optimize, and execute a real-time trading strategy in the stock market by receiving a series of technical indicators and stock price data. The goal of the project is to successfully automate trading. Its potential value is not only automating trading but taking the human emotions and intuition out of the equation for making intelligent investment decisions. The data set will be from a combination of sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, and Alpha Vantage. 

## Project Scope
This project is attainable within 6 weeks because it's simply a build up and continuation of other smaller projects I've worked on in the past. The learning curve, compute resources, and storage capacity has all been accounted for and will be a continual process as the project scales. 6 weeks is enough time in order to develop an MVP with an end-to-end pipeline.

## MVP 
A working and automated Reinforcement Learning pipeline that encorporates data preprocessing, data analysis, data manipulation, and asset management. 

## Data 
1. [Alpaca Real-Time Market Data](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/market-data/)
2. [Alpha Vantage Stock Data](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)
3. [Finding most volatile stocks](https://towardsdatascience.com/find-the-highest-moving-hidden-stocks-of-the-day-with-python-aab0d7bfe5ff)


## Research Papers Summary

1. [Deep Reinforcement Learning (Automated Stock Trading)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690996)
This article was about reinforcement learning for handling probabilistic outcomes. Reinforcement learning heavily relies on a Markov Decision Process that helps determine that actions, states, and rewards. This methodology works with both a discrete and continuous time series. Applying reinforcement learning to stock market trend predictions is relevant because it can handle different variables that the stock market entails in a timely manner through its components. In addition to regular reinforcement learning, applying technical indicators and other information of stock data like news and volitility.

2. [Multiple Stock Trading](https://towardsdatascience.com/finrl-for-quantitative-finance-tutorial-for-multiple-stock-trading-7b00763b7530)
This article presented the idea of other statistical techniques have proven to be proficient in identifying patterns in that which seemed random like the stock market like geometric brownian motion. Brownian Motion was used by Einstein to support his thesis on subatomic particle in pollen moving around in a pattern, concluding that there's an acutal pattern within the randomness and that everything no matter how random has an underlying pattern with respect to its environment. Applying statistical models like GBM, MACD, RSI, and Bollingerbands can help the reinforcement agent to optimize its rewards which is maximizing profit from trades.

3. [Parallel Stochastic RL Learning Environments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690996)
This project is simply an intelligent system that can buy and sell stocks using a predefined trading strategy. Once the script is called it will programmatically connect to a trading platform via an API to get access to real-time data. Then the algorithm will buy and sell as well as implement a stop loss. All of this will be done in a fixed amount of time that will end up being how long the script runs. I should also be able to log in to the brokers‚Äô interface and view the algorithm take positions in the market in real-time.

4. [Machine Learning Pipeline](https://ai.plainenglish.io/advances-in-financial-machine-learning-for-dummies-part-0-c08e169335f)
In this exerpt, the author focused on the significance of a robust machine learning pipeline that can handle large amounts of data and complicated models. Ultimately, it's important to have a scalable pipeline that can handle any type of model or different amounts of data that can be extracted, massaged, and loaded. 

5. [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-stock-prices-in-python-using-geometric-brownian-motion-8dfd6e8c6b18)
Geometric Brownian Motion is a concept used in the finance world to quantify an equities volatility. More specifically, stock options at a given price during a continous interval. Therefore, Geometric Brownian Motion serves itself as a stochastic process that only works with a continuous time series of data. 


## Stretch Goals / Implementation Plan
1. Find time series data for multiple stocks 
2. Scan stock markets to find most volatile stocks 
3. Send that data to a database/spreadsheet 
4. Grab that data  
5. Build a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
6. Train/Test RL Agent on historical data
7. Connect algorithm with real-time data
8. Setup algorithm with a brokerage to take real positions in the market
9. Connect algorithm to a scheduler in GCP
10. Have the Algorithm trade everyday at Market Open and Close
11. Have algorithm send emails, informing me about it's positions
12. Make Money
