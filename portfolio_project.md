# Portfolio Project

## Description
The goal of this course is for each student to produce their own in-depth, Data Science Portfolio Project.


## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Research and analyze an industry-relevant topic in Data Science
1. Master the use of state-of-the art python libraries for data exploration, manipulation, visualization, machine learning and/or deep learning, model validation, and hyperparameter tuning
1. Build a solo portfolio project in an industry-relevant topic that combines skills learned throughout the data science curriculum
1. Engage in technical discussions around their project and those of their classmates
1. Demonstrate their understanding of their project by competing a thorough writeup


## Schedule

From the day this project is assigned, you will have 6 weeks to complete this project. A sample outline is provided to assist you in planning your project.

- Classes 1 - 3: Research topics of interest, identify a suitable project
- Classes 4 - 6: Data exploration, visualization and pre-processing
- Classes 7 - 8: Modeling and validation:
  Select a few appropriate models
  Train and evaluate the models
  Compare results
- Classes 9 - 10
  Select the final model
  Carry out cross-validation experiments to tune the final model hyperparameters
- Class 11:
  Evaluate the Final Model on the test data
  Optionally complete model interpretability experiments
- Class 12: Complete the project code and writeup and submit
- Class 13: Present your project in class


## Phases and Deadlines
Deadlines of project deliverables, split into phases.

- **Phase 1: Proposal - Due Day 3 @ 11:00pm**
  **Deliverables:**
    - Public GitHub Repository Link
    - README.md in the repo with proposal. The README.md file will contain the writeup of your project
  - Approval: Instructor will approve projects by start of class on Day 4.
- **Phase 2: Data Exploration, Visualization, Preprocessing - Due Day 6 @ 11:00pm**
  **Deliverables:**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, completed through Data Exploration, Visualization, Preprocessing phase
- **Phase 3: Modeling and Validation - Due Day 8 @ 11:00pm**
  **Deliverables:**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, completed through Modeling and Validation phase
- **Phase 4: Hyperparameter tuning - Due Day 10 @ 11:00pm**
  **Deliverables:**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, completed through hyperparameter tuning phase
- **Phase 5: Writeup - Due Day 12 @ 11:00pm**
  **Deliverables:**
      - Final Colab notebook with completed code and Final README file with completed writeup


## Requirements
TBD -- List out requirements for the project here

1. Requirement 1
1. Requirement 2
1. Requirement 3

## Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
Carry out model interpretability experiments, include in the code repo and include results as part of the writeup


## Rubric
TBD -- Link to project rubric placed here

## Commit Requirements

All projects will require a minimum of 65 commits, with a minimum of 10 commits per week throughout the entirety of the course

- Good Example: 100+ commits throughout the length of the project, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- Bad Example: 15 commits on each of five days during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- Unacceptable Example:20 commits all in the week before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

## Explanation of the "continuous commits" strategy
We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer.  
Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for a more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset.  
Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.
